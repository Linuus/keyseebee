# Plate files

In version v0.1 and v0.2, the right thumb cluster is not at the exact
same place as the left one. It is corrected in v0.3 and after. If you
need a plate for pre-v0.3, look at the `is_right` option in the code.

You can find here some plates for the keyboard:
 * svg are seen from the top
 * stl are seen from the bottom, to have the visible side on the bed of a 3D printer.
 
The scad file is the source of these files. You can tune it to change,
for example, the swich hole size, depending on the tolerance you need.
